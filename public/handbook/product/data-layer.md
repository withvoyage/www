Every Voyage tool pushes and pulls from the Data Layer. The Data Layer is the central hub where we track contacts, accounts, and events. It's quite similar to a CRM, though we don't use it like one (yet!).

Voyage's central data layer is a key differentiator from other marketing tools. Most tools will rely on a tool like HubSpot to be the place where marketing data goes to die, but since we operate our own, each tool can push and pull from it as it needs.

## Contacts

A contact represents a person. Each contact is unique on their email (or an internal Voyage ID if the email is not available).

## Accounts

An account represents a company. Each account is unique on their domain (or an internal Voyage ID if the domain is not available). Contacts can be associated with accounts, but they don't have to be.

## Events

Contacts will be engaging with your marketing in a variety of ways. These engagements are tracked as events. Each event that is tracked is associated with a contact.
