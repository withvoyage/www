## Install Snippet

All you have to do to install Voyage is navigate to your settings page, find the code snippet for your workspace, and paste that into the header of your website.

If you're using a CMS like WordPress, you can use a plugin like [Insert Headers and Footers](https://wordpress.org/plugins/insert-headers-and-footers/) to add the code snippet to your site.
