Web Analytics is our most basic tool for tracking traffic to your website.

Voyage will automatically track most events on your webpage, so you don't have to do anything to get started.

You can see the data in the platform by going to the [Web Analytics](https://app.withvoyage.com/analytics) page

## Default Metrics

- **Pageviews**: The number of times a page has been viewed.
- **Unique Pageviews**: The number of sessions in which a page was viewed one or more times.
- **Bounce Rate**: The percentage of single-page sessions in which there was no interaction with the page.

We'll also show a graph of pageviews over time.

## How do I use the data?

All data used to construct the metrics shown on this page are pulled from the [Data Layer](/handbook/product/data-layer).

That means that this data is already available in other Voyage tools, no extra work required.
