Website Reveal can reveal individually visitors that view your website. Not just accounts, but visitors too.

We don't roll our own reveal platform, but instead we integration with <a href="https://vector.co" target="_blank">Vector</a>. For more information we recommend checking out their website.

## How do I enable it?

Website Reveal can be turned on in the platform. You can enable it by going to the [Website Reveal](https://app.withvoyage.com/reveal) page and turning it on. As long as you've installed the base Voyage script on your website, you'll start revealing!

## Is this GDPR compliant?

Yes! Our provider will only do visitor-level reveal on US-based IP addresses. For non-US IP addresses, they will only reveal the account level. This is to ensure that we're compliant with GDPR and other privacy laws.

## How do I use the data?

Voyage will automatically send the data you get from Website Reveal into our [Data Layer](/handbook/product/data-layer). It'll instantly be available for use in all integrations and tools that pull from the Data Layer.
