## Definitions

**Marketing Warehouse**: A single source of truth for all of the data that a marketing team generates - usually HubSpot, Marketo, or Salesforce.

**Upstream Tools**: tools that generate data about your potential customers, and eventually push that data into your warehouse. Examples include:

- <a href="https://www.wistia.com/" target="_blank">Wistia</a>
- <a href="https://www.drift.com/" target="_blank">Drift</a>
- <a href="https://optimizely.com/" target="_blank">Optimizely</a>
- <a href="https://www.g2.com/" target="_blank">G2</a>
- <a href="https://6sense.com/" target="_blank">6sense</a>

**Downstream Tools**: tools that consume data from your warehouse to personalize content, generate reports, etc. Examples include:

- <a href="https://www.demandbase.com/" target="_blank">Demandbase</a>
- <a href="https://www.mutinyhq.com/" target="_blank">Mutiny</a>
- a whole bunch of BI tools

## Combining Tools = Voyage

Upstream tools rarely pull data out of the warehouse, and downstream tools rarely push data in. Since each company's warehouse configuration is unique, it's difficult for tools to push and pull data in a way that works for everyone.

This means that each upstream tool is missing out on using data from other upstream tools, and each downstream tool is missing out on using data from other downstream tools.

And it's not uncommon for a company to have 10+ tools in their marketing/growth stack. The data from each tool becomes siloed, rots in the warehouse, and the potential for compounding is lost.

## Our Long Term Vision

We're looking to build as many of these tools in one platform as possible. This way, we can reap the benefits of the data across every tool in Voyage. We'll still send the data to your warehouse, but we'll also use it to make every tool in Voyage better.
