## Software vendors have a responsibility to innovate, even at scale.

Our growth lever should never be “getting better at sales”. We will, but the business must be able to thrive (high bar for NRR/NDR) by building products that scale quickly in value.

Because we believe this, keeping the company product/eng-centric is critical.

## Software should be easy to buy.

A user should be able to find us, sign up, deploy us on their webpage, and see actionable results — all without putting down a credit card or talking to any person on our team.

This means that plans for all products should start at $0/mo, and the product should be easy enough to use that most marketers can get started without needing a CSM or onboarding call.

We should also only charge scaled to the value we provide. Basically, usage-based pricing.
