## Software vendors have a responsibility to innovate, even at scale.

Our growth lever should never be ‚Äúgetting better at sales‚Äù or "move upmarket".

Voyage must be able to thrive _(thrive = high bar for NRR/NDR)_ by building products that are easy to access and scale in value.

Because we believe this, keeping the company product/eng-centric is critical.

<h2 id="upmarket">Marketing software has moved upmarket.</h2>

Since most martech companies are carried by a strong GTM ‚Äî not eng ‚Äî it becomes difficult for them to attract and retain eng talent, slashing shipping speed.

The only growth lever left is moving up-market towards big, juicy, enterprise contracts and leaving the small customer behind. We've seen this happen first hand.

_Many of the companies we‚Äôre replacing have five-figure contract minimums. Not because the software is expensive to run, but because the enterprise GTM teams are expensive to pay._

So we‚Äôre building an eng-first company with a fully PLG version of lots of these tools, topped off with a generous free tier and usage-based pricing.

Simply put - **Voyage will be the only option many startups can afford since we don‚Äôt have a huge operational GTM cost**.

We hope you find Voyage useful enough to stick with us as you scale. üöÄ

## Software should be easy to buy.

A user should be able to find us, sign up, deploy us on their webpage, and see actionable results ‚Äî all without putting down a credit card or talking to any person on our team.

This means that plans for all products should start at $0/mo, and the product should be easy enough to use that most marketers can get started without needing a CSM or onboarding call.

We should also only charge scaled to the value we provide. Basically, usage-based pricing.
