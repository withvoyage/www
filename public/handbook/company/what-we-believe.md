## Software vendors should innovate, even at scale.

Our growth lever should never be ‚Äúgetting better at sales‚Äù or "move upmarket".

Voyage thrives by building products that are

1. easy to get started with
2. scale pricing with value

Because we believe this, keeping the company product/eng-centric is critical.

<h2 id="upmarket">Marketing software has moved upmarket.</h2>

Being carried by a strong GTM makes it hard to keep a culture of shipping product fast.

So it's natural for GTM-led companies to move up-market towards big, juicy, enterprise contracts and leave the small customer behind. We've seen this happen first hand.

Because enterprise GTM motions are expensive, this cost gets forwarded to you, making it unaffordable for startups.

We're building a fully PLG version of these tools, topped off with a generous free tier and usage-based pricing.

**Voyage will be the only option many startups can afford since we don‚Äôt have a huge operational GTM cost**.

We hope you find Voyage useful enough to stick with us as you scale. üöÄ

## Software should be easy to buy.

A user should be able to find us, onboard seamlessly, deploy, and see actionable results ‚Äî all without putting down a credit card or talking to any person on our team.

This means that plans for all products should start at $0/mo, and the product should be easy enough to use that most marketers can get started without needing a CSM or onboarding call.
