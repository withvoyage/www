## Obsess over product

It's one thing to get a bunch of engineers in a room and have them build amazing technology. It's another to have them build amazing product.

Technology is the code base, servers, etc. Product is what you, the user, actually use. It's important to build sustainable technology (more about that [here]()), but we _obsess_ over the product.

## Talk to users

While we've built a lot of marketing tools, we aren't marketers. So, routinely talking to users is a must. For current customers this means:

- Dedicated Slack Connect channel
- 24/7 support
- The literal CEO's phone number (yes, really)

Every member of our team should be talking to users as much as possible.

## Step on toes

By default, we assume positive intention. This makes it easier to step on other people's toes. We do this when committing code, talking to users, giving internal feedback, etc.

We find it much easier to just be direct, get to the point quickly, and address the thing without dancing around it.

## Default to transparency

We hire people who do high quality work. We trust them to do their job. And we trust them to make decisions.

Giving them as much context as possible helps them make better decisions.

We also view transparency as a hiring qualifier. The folks that are attracted to our culture (which you're reading about right now!) will qualify themselves in, and those that aren't will qualify themselves out.
