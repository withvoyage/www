## Startups

If you're running a startup, **Voyage is for you**.

Existing marketing tools aren't for early stage companies. Rarely are they usage-based + they often want annual contracts. <a href="handbook/company/what-we-believe#upmarket" target="_blank">Read why</a>.

In mid-market or enterprise, the goals of marketing are different.

### Pre-Product Market Fit

You're just trying to figure out what work + find a repeatable way to get customers.

It's less important to capture a 5% increase in funnel conversion rates but instead look for the right channels and messaging.

Who is your product for? What do they care about? How do you reach them?

### Post-Product Market Fit

Here, you've figured out how to land consistent revenue. You've got a healthy pipeline that you're looking to optimize.

With a good idea of who your customers are and which messaging works, you're looking to scale and keep tabs on funnel health.

### Where Voyage Works

If you're pre-product market fit, Voyage can help you find the right channels and messaging. And our goal with our free plan is to never charge you until you've hit a consistent revenue stream.

If you don't have consistent revenue and you're outgrowing our free plan, [email me](mailto:bryan.houlton@withvoyage.com) and we'll work something out.

If you're post-product market fit, Voyage can help you optimize your pipeline and keep tabs on funnel health. We're likely still a cheaper option than other tools you're using, plus each of our tools cross-pollinate really well.

## Mid-Market / Enterprise

We're not excluding you. If you're in this category, we'd [love to talk](https://cal.com/bryan-houlton-5uvxqc/mid-market-enterprise-chat).
