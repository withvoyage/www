## Venture-Backed Startups

If you're running a SaaS startup, **Voyage is for you**.

Existing marketing tools aren't for early stage companies. Rarely are they usage-based + they often want annual contracts. <a href="handbook/company/what-we-believe#upmarket" target="_blank">Read why</a>.

Plus, other tools are built for mid-market/enterprise where the goals or marketing are different.

### Pre-Product Market Fit

You're just trying to figure out what work + find a repeatable way to get customers.

It's less important to capture a 5% increase in funnel conversion rates but instead look for the right channels and messaging.

Who is your product for? What do they care about? How do you reach them?

### Post-Product Market Fit

Here, you've figured out how to land consistent revenue. You've got a healthy pipeline that you're looking to optimize.

With a good idea of who your customers are and which messaging works, you're looking to scale and keep tabs on funnel health.

### Where We Fit

Voyage is starting by serving the pre-product market fit stage. We're building tools that help you figure out what works and what doesn't.

We grow by building tools for you once you've figured out what works. As you scale, so does your tool usage with us. Eventually you'll transition off of our free plan and onto something paid.
